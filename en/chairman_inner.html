              Dear stc shareholders,
              <br /> <br />
              Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.
              <br /> <br />
              During 2019, stc made outstanding achievements that enabled it to move forward in terms of digital services that enrich the lives of our customers and employees. The Group plays a key role in enabling digital transformation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in line with the Saudi Vision 2030 and the goals of stc’s DARE strategy for new growth opportunities. On the financial level, consolidated revenues increased by 4.63% in 2019 compared to the same period of the previous year to reach SR 54,368 million, gross profit increased by 6.29% to reach SR 32,391 million, and operating profit increased by 1.92% to reach SR 12,480 million, and the net profit reached SR 10,665 million by the end of 2019.
              <br /> <br />
              In 2019, we culminated our strategy by launching the Group’s new brand, in line with its leading position in the communications and information technology sector in the Kingdom. Today, stc is more than just a company, it’s an integrated system of communications, information technology, and digital solutions. The new brand reflects the Group’s dynamism as a leading digital enabler locally, regionally, and globally. It also aligns with the Group’s progress in the field of digital transformation with digital payments, media, and entertainment, in line with the digital data revolution and accelerating changes in the communications and information technology sector.
              <br /> <br />
              The Group also maintained its commitment to empowering Saudi human resources, relying on qualified staff, appointing young Saudis in leadership positions, and empowering women to take on important leading positions. All these measures are aimed at improving the Group’s performance, in line with its pivotal role in enabling digital transformation in the Kingdom for the government and private sectors in accordance with the Saudi Vision 2030.
              As for global rankings, stc scored top positions from several international entities. For instance, stc ranked first in the MENA region according to Forbes Magazine, among the world’s top 50 digital companies, and one of the world’s top 10 largest communications companies in terms of market value. stc also obtained the 2019 Best Practices Award in the Business Intelligence, Visual Analytics, and Data Discovery category from TDWI, which is considered the premier source for in-depth education and research on all things data.
              <br /> <br />
              Additionally, stc took the lead in launching commercial 5G services in the Kingdom, Kuwait, and Bahrain, as the first operator in the region. stc strived to accelerate the deployment of the 5G network that offers a great technological transformation and an essential network for the applications of the future. This contributed to the development of the communications and information technology sector in the Kingdom and the improvement of the infrastructure in which stc invested to pave the way for a high-tech future.
              <br /> <br />
              Furthermore, stc won the 2,300MHz frequency band with a 15-year license starting from 1/1/2020. Obtaining these frequencies is an additional investment aimed at creating a significant increase in mobile network capacities, in order to meet the growing demand for services, increase internet speed and quality, and provide the best communications services. Thanks to its investments in infrastructure, stc obtained the award of the fastest mobile network in the Kingdom from Ookla, the broadband speed test company. stc also obtained the award of the highest mobile internet download speed in the Kingdom during Q3 2019, according to the Meqyas report issued by the Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC).
              <br /> <br />
              To support tech startups with innovative solutions that contribute to increasing their added value, the Group signed a cooperation agreement with the Badir Technology Incubators and Accelerators Program. Therefore, stc offers its services to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), starting from the establishment of an enterprise’s infrastructure, to the provision of day-to-day technical services such as the phone and the Internet, and advanced services such as cloud computing, cybersecurity solutions, sales management, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
              In 2019, stc also achieved great leaps locally and regionally. stc was the first operator in the region to activate DNSSEC for its main domain, and the first telecommunications company in the Middle East to obtain membership in the Social International Value Organization. The Group also became a member of NB-IoT and was selected by GSMA to represent Saudi Arabia in the Global Artificial Intelligence Challenge.
              <br /> <br />
              Given its role in local content promotion and localization, stc obtained membership in the Local Content Coordination Council. This council emanated from the Local Content Partnerships initiative, which was launched by the Local Content and Government Procurement Authority, as its first strategic initiative to establish a sustainable partnership with leading national companies and the private sector to develop local content. stc also concluded a joint cooperation agreement with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) to promote local and foreign investments, in order to increase local content and highlight product localization opportunities.
              <br /> <br />
              Finally, in recognition of the unlimited support provided by our wise leadership, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz, and to the Crown Prince HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Their tremendous support of the communications and information technology sector in the Kingdom contributed to its development and growth, and to the improvement of its infrastructure in record time, thus helping achieve digital transformation in line with the goals of the Saudi Vision 2030. I would also like to thank the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) and the CITC for their contribution to developing the digital capabilities of the Kingdom and keeping pace with national requirements and global developments. Many thanks also to our esteemed shareholders for their trust and continuous support for the board, to our valued customers who are our success partners, and to my colleagues in the Group inside and outside the Kingdom for their hard work to ensure the continued success of the Group.
              <br /> <br /> 
              Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.
              <br /> <br />
