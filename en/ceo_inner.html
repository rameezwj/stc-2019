            Dear stc shareholders,
            <br /><br />
            Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings.
            <br /><br />
            2019 was a significant year in the history of the Group. stc made massive leaps rendering it a leading digital enabler for the public and private sectors both locally and regionally, thus contributing to one of the main goals of the Saudi Vision 2030. For instance, stc advanced the fields of big data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence. It also supported Saudi talents in technology and innovation. Additionally, stc increased financial results compared to the previous year, supported by increased revenues from the consumer and wholesale sectors and the subsidiaries of the Group.
            <br /><br />
            2019 was also the year the Group launched its new unified commercial brand “stc” in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain, to enhance its performance and its role as a leading digital enabler in the region, and highlight its role in enriching the lives of its customers by providing innovative communications services and products that enable the business sector to operate effectively and economically. The new brand marks the start of a new journey for stc, whose establishment in 1998 was a key event in the telecommunications and technology sector. Over the course of 21 years, stc proved to be one of the most important success stories of privatization and expansion in the Kingdom and the region.
            <br /><br />
            To boost its financial standing and to demonstrate the success of its investment plans in the era of digital technologies and services, stc achieved great success with its investment in Careem, which was acquired by Uber for US $3.1 billion. The Group's share in Careem is around 8.8%, which amounts to US $274 million. The Group will also continue to support creative projects and ideas that keep up with the rapid changes in the industry and in the lifestyle of customers.
            <br /><br />
            In the field of digital payments, stc Pay achieved remarkable success in the Kingdom. A year after its launch, stc pay became one of the best financial services and money transfer tools in terms of quality and cost. stc pay offers its services in more than 30,000 points of sale in the Kingdom and deals with over 525,000 approved Western Union agents worldwide.
            <br /><br />
            As part of its efforts to enrich the lifestyle of individuals and institutions, complete the digitization of the infrastructure, and address the challenges faced by the health sector, stc business concluded a strategic agreement with Philips to activate the Ministry of Health's Digital Initiatives project by providing Tele-ICU health care services.
            <br /><br />
            As part of stc’s initiatives to disseminate broadband services in the Kingdom, especially since it owns the largest, fastest, and most advanced fiber optic network in the region, the Group signed an agreement with Zain KSA to deliver fiber optic broadband services to homes. Under this agreement, Zain KSA benefits from stc’s infrastructure to deploy broadband services and offer integrated services in the communications and information technology sector and enable digital services in various regions of the Kingdom.
            <br /><br />
            During 2019, stc culminated its collaborations with international partners to improve the system of 5G services and new technologies by launching the first commercial offer of 5G services in the Kingdom, Kuwait, and Bahrain.
            <br /><br />
            As part of the Group’s commitment to provide possible tools to support women at work, and its efforts to improve women’s experience in business environments and increase their job satisfaction, stc launched the first board for women’s empowerment to enhance their participation in the labor market. In this regard, stc is driven by its belief in the importance of investing in its employees and giving them the best opportunities to develop their skills and capacities, in line with the National Transformation Program, which aims to enable all segments of society to enter the labor market, improve its attractiveness, and increase the economic participation of Saudi women.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, to emphasize the Group’s leadership, its brand was among the top 50 most valuable Saudi brands in 2019 according to Brand Finance, with a value of US $7.095 billion and an increase of 6.7% compared to the previous year, which reflects the excellence of stc’s brand. In addition, stc won seven awards at the Transform Awards MENA in Dubai for its branding.
            <br /><br />
            With stc receiving many awards and certificates, we can call 2019 the year of the harvest. For instance, stc business received the world’s top cloud computing services certification from VMware, which is a company specialized in providing cloud solutions and services, making stc the first Saudi company to be internationally certified and accredited as a cloud computing service provider. The Group also obtained the award of the fastest mobile network in the Kingdom from Ookla, the broadband speed test company. Additionally, stc obtained the award of the highest mobile internet download speed in the Kingdom in Q3 2019 from the Meqyas report issued by the CITC. Furthermore, the digital payment company, stc Pay, obtained the gold award for the best visual identity in the financial services sector, in addition to the gold award for the best development of a new brand within a portfolio.
            <br /><br />
            stc, one of the Group's subsidiaries, ranked as the top provider of information technology services in the Kingdom according to a report issued by IDC, which specializes in market research. Additionally, stc obtained the 2019 Best Practices Award in the Business Intelligence, Visual Analytics, and Data Discovery category from TDWI, the premier source for in-depth education and research on all things data. Mystc application received the App of the Year Golden Award at the Network PG's 2019 IT World Awards.
            <br /><br />
            With steady steps and a clear vision, stc strives to achieve its sustainability strategy, as a leader in providing digital services and innovative platforms for its customers in the MENA region. Indeed, stc adopted the values of Dynamism, Devotion and Drive to further improve its business, through a new, smart, and innovative vision. stc also strives to work for the best of its customers and employees and provide them with the best solutions possible.
            <br /><br />
            Moreover, the stc Group is keen to support innovation and entrepreneurship and promote initiative-taking among Saudi youth. In this regard, stc launched the “Future Solutions” platform to support young Saudi talent in the fields of technology and innovation, by investing and offering innovative technology solutions to create a suitable environment for local talent to contribute to making Saudi Arabia a strong competitor in the world of modern technology. stc also established the InspireU business incubator to support entrepreneurs in the communications and information technology sector. InspireU currently supports 28 projects, with a total investment amounting to US $80 million, which contributed to creating more than 160,000 job opportunities, including part-time jobs.
            <br /><br />
            As part of the Group’s achievements to serve pilgrims, it introduced 5G technologies for the first time during the Hajj season and it expanded the 4G network by 50% compared to the previous year. These expansions proved most effective at peak hours, which saw a huge surge in activity compared to the previous year.
            <br /><br />
            stc plays a key role in enabling digital transformation, developing the communications and information technology sector in the Kingdom, and enriching the lives of its customers by providing innovative digital solutions and the latest wireless technologies to connect to the Internet with a faster data transmission, reception and download speeds. In this context, stc provided 5G services to the visitors of many events organized by the Kingdom, including the Future Investment Initiative (Davos in the Desert), Formula E races, and Saudi Seasons.
            <br /><br />
            In conclusion, I would like to extend my gratitude to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, HRH Prince Mohammed bin Khalid Abdullah Al Faisal, the esteemed members of the board, and our valued shareholders for their confidence and support. I would also like to thank all the employees of stc Group for their outstanding hard work that helped stc grow and move forward. Thanks to all of you, stc strengthened its leading position locally, regionally, and globally by establishing a strong and developed digital infrastructure that contributes to accelerating the digital transformation process, and supports the Saudi Vision 2030 aimed at strengthening the role of the communications and information technology sector in building a digital society, a digital government, and a thriving digital economy.
