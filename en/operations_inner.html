                stc
                In 2019, stc continued deploying the fiber optic network across the Kingdom to fulfill its commitment to achieving the digital initiatives outlined in Saudi Vision 2030, as part of the National Broadband (NBB) Network Initiative. The number of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service customers increased by 23% in 2019 compared to the previous year. By the end of 2019, the length of the optical fiber service cables was about 217,000 km. As a testimony of stc’s commitment to maintaining its leading position, the Meqyas report issued by the CITC indicated that stc achieved the highest average mobile internet download speed in the Kingdom, reaching 45.4 Mbps. This achievement was possible, thanks to stc’s continuous investments in infrastructure. To continue the integration project for infrastructure development, stc launched 5G services in the Kingdom as the first operator to offer the service for commercial use and make it available to customers in a number of Saudi cities. Over 2,300 5G towers were installed during 2019. It is expected that 5G technology will play a major role in enabling digital transformation, as it will serve as an essential platform for future applications in areas such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, which will enable the emergence of smart cities and facilities, support the cybersecurity infrastructure, and provide high-speed mobile internet in all the regions of the Kingdom. On another front, the Company launched the new unified brand “stc” for it and its subsidiaries in the Kingdom, Kuwait, and Bahrain, to keep up with the Group’s progress in the field of digital transformation with digital payments, media, and entertainment, in line with the accelerating changes in the communications and information technology sector.  The new brand helped enhance its value as one of the most valuable brands in the Middle East in 2019 according to the Brand Finance Index, reaching SR 26.6 billion (US $7.1 billion). stc was also ranked among the world’s top 50 digital companies and the first in the Middle East and North Africa in 2019 according to Forbes Magazine. <br /><br />
                Furthermore, stc invested in supporting creative solutions and digital transformation. For instance, it developed digital payments, big data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, stc inaugurated the King Saud Medical City Infrastructure project. With the active participation of the Ministry of Health, stc managed to complete the implementation of managed services and cloud computing for the digital infrastructure of the King Saud Medical City, rendering it one of the most distinguished digital medical cities in the region.  The Company, represented by stc Business, entered into a strategic agreement with Philips to activate the Ministry of Health's Digital Initiatives project by providing Tele-ICU health care services.
                In cooperation with the Ministry of Health, the Company also launched telemedicine services that will contribute in providing the highest levels of remote medical care to patients regardless of their geographical location. <br /><br />
                As an affirmation of stc’s leading position as a provider of innovative digital solution services, stc Business recently obtained the cloud computing services certification by VMware, which is a company specialized in providing cloud solutions and services, making stc the first Saudi company to be internationally certified and accredited as a cloud computing service provider. The Company’s wholesale business also achieved qualitative achievements, by meeting needs and providing international services to business units within the Company in terms of telephone and internet services, as well as to the Company's customers consisting of local, regional, and international operators, service providers, and the regional business sector.
