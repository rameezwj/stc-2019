              As the leading national company in the communications and information technology sector in the Kingdom and the main enabler of digital transformation, stc continues its social responsibility achievements, while enhancing growth in new unconventional tracks to enrich community life.
              <br /><br />
              The transformation journey includes all the Company’s business and the improvement of its performance in cooperation with all relevant parties in an effort to stay abreast of global trends. The Company thus identifies opportunities, mitigates risks, and introduces the desirable change in order to develop and increase its ability to adjust to the evolving business environment. stc adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and conducted an assessment of the goals it can contribute to achieving. Next, stc linked those goals with its sustainability approach. Thanks to its firmly grounded culture of social responsibility since its establishment, stc always supports social responsibility projects and programs.
              <br /><br />
              stc's partnership with King Khalid Foundation in 2018 helped advance stc’s sustainability to further and more innovative dimensions in 2019. As a result, stc maximized and sustained the impact of social responsibility programs, and managed to measure non-financial performance, while tapping into the Foundation’s rich and diverse relations with non-profit entities in the Kingdom. The sustainability strategy was based on four pillars:

              During this past eventful year, and in line with its commitment to sustainability leadership and partnership and relationship activation at the regional and international levels, stc joined a number of leading international sustainability and social responsibility organizations specialized in impact measurement. For instance, stc joined Social Value International, an organization headquartered in Britain and accredited by the British Cabinet. Social Value International has members from 45 countries, and it specializes in measurement criteria for Social Return on Investment (SROI), with the goal of measuring the social, environmental, and economic impacts of projects. stc’s journey during the year was culminated by joining the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), a leading international independent organization specializing in sustainability reporting since 1997, and which helps businesses understand the impact of their operations on sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance, and social well-being. stc is the first telecommunications company in the region to become a member of such international organizations. The Company also joined the recently established Supply Chain and Procurement Society, a non-profit society developing the supply chain and procurement sector in the Kingdom, providing value-added and sustainable services to support the local content, localizing knowledge and technology for the benefit of national personnel, building strategic relationships with local and international partners to adopt a governance system and build an effective corporate communication system with government and private entities, and activating cooperation and integration with such entities.With these steps, the Company is adding an unprecedented achievement to its proven track record.

              As the Group believes in the important role of Saudi women in national development, it designed and planned this project. Launched in 2018 in line with the Company’s sustainability strategy, this project aims to empower women, boost their presence in specialized fields in communications and technology, and build a digital society that effectively contributes to realizing comprehensive development. As part of the “Aqdimi stc” initiative, a session was held to discuss the "difficult conversations" in the work environment, the challenges that working women face in the labor market, and solutions to enhance women's role and empowerment in the Communications and Information Technology field. The Company also participated as a platinum sponsor in the “Forum of Women in the communications and information technology sector” organized by the MCIT at its headquarters in Riyadh and attended by more than 400 women interested in the technology field. The forum aimed to educate Saudi women in the technology field and motivate them to gain knowledge and experience. stc announced the creation of the first board to empower women and promote their participation in the labor market, chaired by the Group’s CEO. The board is an internal reference for all matters related to the Company's female employees, with the goal of supporting and empowering them in various fields, especially in leadership positions based on meritocracy.The Company is proud of offering Saudi women the opportunity to assert themselves in the communications and information technology sector.

              stc aims to enable the third sector and non-profit organizations and build their capacities to help them make a sustainable impact, in light of the various challenges they face, such as the insufficient specialized human resources and the lack of professional practices in the development of the third sector and non-profit organizations. This project was launched by the corporate responsibility department, and it succeeded in attracting over 1000 employees across the Kingdom to register as volunteers. Since its creation, this club promoted a culture of specialized volunteering among employees and stressed its importance for social development by tapping into specialized human resources working across all specialties in the Company (information technologies, programming, marketing, translation). The club also developed the volunteers’ capabilities by helping them acquire new skills and experiences through volunteering for certain hours in various charities.Since its beginning, the club organized and expanded volunteer activities to maximize their impact, and provided specialized volunteer services to nonprofit organizations concerned with communication difficulties to save costs, increase work efficiency, and reach final beneficiaries.The club suggested a minimum volunteering time of two hours per week, 8 hours per month, and 24 hours per year.

              The Group strives to promote a culture of social entrepreneurship in the internal and external communications community. In this context, the Group launched the “Impact- U” Project, a social business incubator aimed at helping develop innovative solutions for today’s social problems or find and leverage opportunities for the development of the local community. Through “Impact- U”, stc seeks to involve society members in coming up with sustainable development solutions and localize a culture of social innovation to create a social impact and address the local economic and environmental challenges. This project challenges all participants to collaborate and compete to identify a social problem and suggest a solution. Next, it incubates ideas in an initial incubation phase focused on problem analysis, solution development, and impact measurement. In the last stage, i.e. final incubation, workshops are held to test solution models and build work and change theory models. The project is aligned with Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to sustain and enhance the role and impact of the nonprofit sector, by activating social responsibility in this sector through the innovation of projects with a positive social return and encouraging the private sector to pay it forward through sustainability and social responsibility programs.

The most notable of those challenges are reduced transparency, low performance and productivity in the third sector, the lack of integration of charities’ data, and the weak infrastructure of charities’ technical systems. All these difficulties lead to inefficient services for beneficiaries and call for an advanced and efficient system to organize charities’ needs in terms of human resources, accounting, donation management, and others. As stc believes in its important and instrumental role, and out of its commitment to social responsibility, the Company adopted the ERP for charities program, with specialized partners that have extensive technical expertise. Today, around 20 charities and nonprofit organizations are benefiting from this program, and many more throughout the Kingdom will join them soon. The project is an integrated electronic platform to plan and manage the resources of charitable organizations and associations. The project’s settings can be customized through an unlimited number of accounts, departments, divisions, cost centers, activities, profit centers, account analysis, and classifications of goods and services.

              <br /><br />
              The Group strives to improve its business and initiatives to be in line with its sustainability and social impact goals. As a demonstration of its commitment to adopting sustainable business practices, the Group developed the stc Grant Program. This program aims to change the culture of direct sponsorship for charity programs and projects, by sponsoring projects that have a high social impact and value, and that can improve work quality and procedures within organizations or help solve a social issue in a creative manner to benefit the final beneficiaries, in accordance with standards and controls that aim to achieve the program’s objectives. The program aims to build the capacities of the nonprofit sector and find sustainable and innovative solutions for development problems, in order to enable different segments in society and maximize social impact, by targeting nonprofit organizations that focus on people with communication problems, such as the vision and hearing impairment, and individuals with stuttering problems, down syndrome, and autism.  The program also focuses on designing innovative technological solutions for social challenges. In accordance with the SROI measurement criteria and method, projects and programs go through six stages, namely: determining the project’s scope and identifying and involving stakeholders, describing results by creating an “Impact Map” in cooperation with stakeholders, verifying and evaluating results, assessing impact using several approved assessment methods, measuring SROI, and preparing and submitting the final report to stakeholders. In order to benefit from this program, the charity must be licensed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Development (MLSD), target people with low income or with communication problems, and focus on at least one social investment area, such as communication through technology, workforce development, and innovative digital solutions.
